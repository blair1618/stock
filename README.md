*A practical starter for cross-platform OpenGL applications*

Just like soup stock, the code here is convenient material for getting something delicious cooking without too much prep time.

Applications using Stock can be developed and run on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows (using ANGLE).

Stock is simple. Its main ingredients are:

 - Window creation and input (via GLFW)
 - Vertex/index mesh helpers
 - Shader program helpers
 - Texture helpers and image decoding (via stb_image.h)
 - Vector and matrix types and utilities (via GLM)
 - A template for application prototyping
